\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{The significant of troubleshooting analysis}

Cutting cost, reducing downtime, and extending lifespan of equipment are some business goals in the heavy equipment industry. In order to meet these targets, preventative maintenance can be the best practice; however, depending on environment and workload, equipment can fail at any time between service intervals. For this reason, technicians must equip themselves with appropriate troubleshooting skills.

Hydraulics are a main focus in the heavy equipment maintenance world. Likewise, in CAT 637G, hydraulics are also used in many places, including cushion-hitch, auger, push-pull hydraulic systems. Despite of versatile abilities, hydraulic systems are susceptible to contamination since components are usually exposed to dusty environments. Compared to other hydraulic systems, the powertrain might less prone to contamination since its components are less exposed. Therefore, their service life may be longer than other hydraulic systems, but failures can cause longer downtime. This research will provide some diagnostic instructions to solve hydraulic systems and powertrain issues.

Understanding how to solve hydraulic and powertrain problems benefits both equipment owners and technicians. The ability to keep equipment in shape helps companies save money for other business goals and builds their reputation. As the vast majority of equipment heavily depends on hydraulics to do the job, including powertrain, technicians or students with troubleshooting skill in this field can consolidate their positions or increase the chances of getting a good job.

\subsection{Scope}

As the paper has word limitation, the research will cover basic diagnostic instructions for common hydraulics and powertrain issues of CAT 637G. Typically, the focused areas of hydraulics are the cushion-hitch circuit and general hydraulic systems, while the focused area of powertrain is only the torque converter. Besides, this paper also includes some safety measures as a part of troubleshooting procedures.

\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

\subsection{Sections}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.


\subsection{Comments}

You can add inline TODO comments with the todonotes package, like this:
\todo[inline, color=green!40]{This is an inline comment.}

\subsection{References}

LaTeX automatically generates a bibliography in the APA style from your .bib file. The citep command generates a formatted citation in parentheses \cite{Lamport1986}. The cite command generates one without parentheses. LaTeX was first discovered by \cite{Lamport1986}.

\subsection{Tables and Figures}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command as in the code for Figure~\ref{fig:frog} below.

% Commands to include a figure:
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier


\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

We hope you find write\LaTeX\ useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above.
