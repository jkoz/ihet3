INTRODUCTION
============

“With today’s highly sophisticated machinery and with the advent of mass
production, industry can no longer afford a failure, as the cost of
downtime is prohibitive.” [@DodPracHyd p. 190]. To avoid these
unexpected failures, techncians should recognize common symtoms and fix
them before equipment breaks down.

Purpose
-------

The goal of this report is to provide essential hydraulic and powertrain
troubleshooting skills on Caterpillar scraper 637G. This research is
significant due to the popularity of utilizing hydraulics in heavy
equipment. As the vast majority of equipment heavily depends on
hydraulics to do the job, including powertrain, technicians or students
with troubleshooting skill in this field can consolidate their positions
or increase the chances of getting a good job. In order to provide an
in-depth analysis of the hydraulics and powertrain system, this report
will not examine entire the 637G’s hydraulic systems, which is not
timely feasible.

Background
----------

Just like a human body, if the owners and technicians neglect minor
problems of equipment, things will get worse. Companies can have a
comprehensive preventative maintenance strategy for their fleet;
nevertheless, equipment still can fail at any time between service
intervals because equipment health heavily relies on working
environments. Hydraulic systems are very susceptible to contamination
since components, such as cylinder seals are exposed to dusty
environments. On the other hand, the powertrain might less prone to
contamination as its components are less exposed. Therefore, their
service life may be longer than other hydraulic systems, but their
failures can cause longer downtime

Scope
-----

Just like other heavy equipment, the 637G scraper uses hydraulics in
many places: the bowl, apron, ejector, cushion-hitch, auger, steering,
and powertrain. Because of the large amount of hydraulic implementation
used in the 637G, this paper will merely concentrate on the
cushion-hitch, auger, and torque converter. Typically, the report will
cover the purposes, locations, and basic diagnostic and troubleshooting
knowledge for cushion-hitch, auger, and torque converter. Besides, the
paper also incorporates safety procedures along with technical
troubleshooting measures.

EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION
=====================

History Background
------------------

“Invention of the scraper, as we know it today, is credited to Robert
Gilmour LeTourneau, who had established his own earthmoving business in
1922.” [@KthGnterth p. 59] Robert and his brother-in-law Ray Peterson
built the first earthmoving scraper in June, 1922 in Stockton,
California. After the first scraper was built by Letourneau in 1922, the
author created a second version of earthmoving scraper, nicknamed the
Gondola. Later, the third edition Mountain Mover was created in 1923.
The self-propelled scraper was the fourth built. Letourneau continuously
dedicated his life to improve his creations [@RLMBldng].

Components
----------

The CAT 637G is a typical earthmoving scraper, designed for quick
loading, hauling, dumping, and spreading of loose material. The below
picture is a illustration of 637G.

The CAT 637G has a excellent self-loading capability in a wide range of
material. It is designed to load material with auger mechanism which
allows material distributed throughout the bowl. As shown in below
figure, an earthmoving scraper has two parts: tractor and scraper.

As shown above picture, a typical scraper has follwing components:

-   A bowl is responsible for loading and carrying material with the
    help of cutting edge and auger mechanism.

-   An auger in front of the bowl lifts material off of the
    cutting edge. It also helps to distribute material evenly throughout
    the bowl

-   An apron mounted in font of the auger retains material upon hauling.

-   An ejector internally mounted in the end of the bowl helps to
    discharge material during spreading.

DIAGNOSTIC AND TROUBLESHOOTING ANALYSIS
=======================================

Hydraulic Systems
-----------------

The 637G uses hydraulics in various places: steering, cushion-hitch,
bowl, apron, ejector, auger, and bail. As mentioned in the previous
section, only cushion-hitch and auger hydraulic systems will be
examined.

### Cushion-hitch Hydraulic System and Service

“The function of a cushion hitch system,…, is to act as a connection
device when it is mounted between the scraper.”[@GOASspns]. Below
pictures taken from HeavyEquipment.org shows the left and right side of
scraper gooseneck, cushion-hitch pump, and its control system.

![\[fig:cshh\]Cushion-hitch hydraulic components.
[@GOASspns]](cushion-hitch-comp-location.png){width="\textwidth"}

Cushion-hitch components includes following: (1) Accumulators, (2) Load
cylinders, (3) Tractor bracket assembly, (4) Scraper hitch assembly, (5)
Lower link, (6) Upper link, (7) Gooseneck, (8) Leveling valve, (9)
Cushion-hitch pump, (10) Lubrication points, (11) Cushion-hitch button.

Two nitrogen accumulators help to dampen vertical movement by
compressing nitrogen gas, and constantly providing oil back and forth to
the load cylinder to stablize the equipment. The load cylinder lifts the
hitch assembly off the tractor bracket in cushion ride mode. In lockdown
mode, load cylinder is bottomed, providing a rigid connection between
the scraper and tractor. As shown in below schematic taken from SIS
portal, the 637G cushion-hitch features a load-sensing pump working with
two accumulators.

According to Caterpillar, as a rule of thumb, the first step of
servicing any hydraulic systems, such as cushion-hitch, auger is to
perform a visual inspection, which will help to identify any leakage,
component damage, loose or missing components. After that, operation
tests can be done to find leakage in the system, a failed valve or a
failed pump. The hydraulic oil should be warmed up to 115 to 125F before
performing do any test [@SISCat]. In order to reach normal operating
temperature, operators have to run the engine at high idle for at least
5 minutes[@SISCat]. Below table shows common hydraulic faults and
possible causes.
